This round was spent in agony, as any other round I participate after several months of inactivity.

My biggest mistake in this round was pretty silly: I expected 300 to be a standard math/greedy problem and couldn't realise it was the simplest dynamic programming problem ever met on Topcoder.

After an hour of looking for "universal greedy" I gave up and prepared several test cases for challenge phase.

I got lucky during challenge phase and could achieve 50 pts. It is not much but I still consider myself quite lucky getting something in room full of red-yellow coders.

Ironically, a lot of bluish-yellowish coders solved 300 with no problems. Next time, after spending N minutes on greedy solution, I will pivot to dp, as I did it before.

After the round this solution seems the most obvious thing. Unfortunately I did a wrong assumption that no dp is applicable.

The funny thing is: a lot of coders failed with greedy solutions on system test phase and I jumped to fourth hundred. That spoiled round gave me some positive rating and lesson for future.
